#Welcome to my Mastermind game!

##There's a lot of excess right now, but here's how you play.

For files, you only need mastermind.js
However for compiling and running the script, you need Node v10.14.x or later
and you need the prompt-sync package.

If you don't have node, run
```
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

Then, to get prompt-sync, run
```
$ npm install prompt-sync
```
Once both of those are good to go, simply node mastermind.js
